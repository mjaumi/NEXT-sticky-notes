# Sticky Notes - A notes managing app

Live Preview Link: [https://sticky-notes-three-olive.vercel.app](https://sticky-notes-three-olive.vercel.app).

## Description

This is an application built with `Next.js` where user can add, edit & delete notes. The main design inspiration of this application came from the [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/21415301-Task-Management-App) that I found casually surfing the internet. I have implemented `socket.io` in this project and thus, user can experience a realtime update in the UI from anywhere, anytime. I have created a simple & basic backend for this project using `Node.js`, `Express.js` & `MongoDB`.
